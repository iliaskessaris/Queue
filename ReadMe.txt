This project implements the queue abstract data type, using linked lists, and the basic operations 
like enqueue(), dequeue(), Size(), Front(), Back(), Empty() that can be done on it. Furthermore, when
the program starts execution builds the queue from the file Queue.txt, if it exists, otherwise it creates
it and before its termination stores queues's data in the file Queue.txt.
